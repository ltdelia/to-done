# To Done

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To Done is not your average to-do app. While it is built with the essential features of a to-do app, it will ultimately do so much more.

## Motivation

The motivation to build To Done mostly came out of a desire to learn several frameworks and libraries, and put them to use in a simplified app environment. 

To Done is built with the following technologies:

- React for front-end development 
- Tailwind CSS and React Material UI (MUI) for front-end style and design
- Firebase / Firestore for NoSQL database management and CRUD operations
- Github Pages for serving the minified production application.

## Use

With the To Done app, you can create, edit, mark complete, and delete any and all of your to-dos! Incomplete to-dos are shown first, and can then be toggled to show complete to-dos. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### `npm run predeploy`

Runs `npm run build`. See `npm run build` for more information.

### `npm run deploy`

Deploys the minified production build of the app (found in the `build` folder) to the `gh-pages` branch, which is then served via Github Pages for the project.
